In the lateral aspect of the left lower eyelid on the inner conjunctival surface is a 1\nmm in maximum dimension petechial hemorrhage. Very fine, less than 1 mm petechial hemorrhages are present on the skin of the upper eyelids\nbilaterally as well as on the lateral left cheek. On everything the left upper eyelid there are much smaller, less than 1 mm petechial hemorrhages\nlocated on the conjunctival surface. Possible petechial hemorrhages are also seen on the conjunctival surfaces of the right upper and lower eyelids,\nbut liver mortis on this side of the face makes definite identification difficult. A deep ligature furrow encircles the entire neck. The width of the furrow varies from one- eight of an inch to five/sixteenths of an inch and is\nhorizontal in orientation, with little upward deviation. The skin of the anterior neck above and below the ligature furrow contains areas of petechial\nhemorrhage and abrasion encompassing an area measuring approximately 3 x 2 inches. The ligature furrow crosses the anterior midline of the neck\njust below the laryngeal prominence, approximately at the level of the cricoid cartilage. It is almost completely horizontal with slight upward\ndeviation from the horizontal towards the back of the neck. The midline of the furrow mark on the anterior neck is 8 inches below the top of the\nhead. The midline of the furrow mark on the posterior neck is 6.75 inches below the top of the head. The area of abrasion and petechial hemorrhage of the skin of the anterior neck includes on the lower left neck, just to the left of the midline, a\nroughly triangular, parchment-like rust colored abrasion which measures 1.5 inches in length with a maximum width of 0.75 inches. This roughly\ntriangular shaped abrasion is obliquely oriented with the apex superior and lateral. The remainder of the abrasions and petechial hemorrhages of the\nskin above and below the anterior projection of the ligature furrow are nonpatterned, purple to rust colored, and present in the midline, right, and\nleft areas of the anterior neck. The skin just above the ligature furrow along the right side of the neck contains petechial hemorrhage composed of\nmultiple confluent very small petechial hemorrhages as well as several larger petechial hemorrhages measuring up to one-sixteenth and one-eight of\nan inch in maximum dimension. Similar smaller petechial hemorrhages are present on the skin below the ligature furrow on the left lateral aspect of\nthe neck.

Several linear aggregates of petechial hemorrhages are present in the anterior left shoulder just\nabove deltopectoral groove. These measure up to one inch in length by one-sixteenth to one-eight of an inch in width. On the left lateral aspect of\nthe lower back, approximately sixteen and one-quarter inches and seventeen and one-half inches below the level of the top of the head are two\ndried rust colored to slightly purple abrasions. The more superior of the two measures one-eight by one-sixteenth of an inch and the more inferior\nmeasures three-sixteenths by one-eight of an inch. There is no surrounding contusion identified. On the posterior aspect of the left lower leg, almost\nin the midline, approximately 4 inches above the level of the heel are two small scratch-like abrasions which are dried and rust colored. They\nmeasure one-sixteenth by less than one- sixteenth of an inch and one-eight by less than one-sixteenth of an inch respectively. On the anterior aspect of the perineum, along the edges of closure of the labia majora, is a small amount of dried blood. A similar small amount of\ndried and semifluid blood is present on the skin of the fourchette and in the vestibule. Inside the vestibule of the vagina and along the distal vaginal\nwall is reddish hyperemia. This hyperemia is circumferential and perhaps more noticeable on the right side and posteriorly. The hyperemia also\nappears to extend just inside the vaginal orifice. A 1 cm red-purple area of abrasion is located on the right posterolateral area of the 1 x 1 cm\nhymeneal orifice. The hymen itself is represented by a rim of mucosal tissue extending clockwise between the 2 and 10:00 positions. The area of\nabrasion is present at approximately the 7:00 position and appears to involve the hymen and distal right lateral vaginal wall and possibly the area\nanterior to the hymen. On the right labia majora is a very faint area of violent discoloration measuring approximately one inch by three-eighths of an\ninch. Incision into the underlying subcutaneous tissue discloses no hemorrhage. A minimal amount of semiliquid thin watery red fluid is present in the\nvaginal vault.
