ABC is a 51-year-old female with a BMI today of\n43. She is 5'4\" tall and weighs 252 pounds. She is motivated to attempt surgical weight loss because she has been overweight for over 20 years\nand wants to lose weight slowly and be more active with her grandchildren and be healthier. She is mainly affected physically by her weight. When\nshe loses weight she always regains it and she always gains back more weight than she has lost. At one time, she lost 25 pounds and gained the\nweight back in about six months. She has done numerous commercial weight loss programs including Weight Watcher's for six months in 1997,\n1999, 2002, and 2004 with a 10 to 25-pound weight loss, TOPS Program in 1998 with a ten-pound weight loss, hypnosis for four months in\n1988 with a 20-pound weight loss, an exercise program for two months in 2008 with six-pound weight loss, and Six Week Body Makeover for\none month in 2008 with a two-pound weight loss. She did Nutri-Systems for six months in 1995 with a 20-pound weight loss and she was under\nyour medical supervision in 2006 where she actually gained 12 pounds.
