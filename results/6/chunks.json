Subsequently, the patient was evaluated and based on the criteria, he was started on high\ndose of aspirin and IVIG. Echocardiogram was also done, which was negative. IVIG was done x1, and between 12 hours of IVIG, he spiked\nfever again; it was repeated twice, and then after second IVIG, he did not spike any more fever. Today, his fever and his rash have completely\nresolved. He does not have any conjunctivitis and no redness of mucous membranes. He is more calm and quite and taking good p.o.; so with a\nvery close followup and a cardiac followup, he will be sent home.",
