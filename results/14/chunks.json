Upon EMS arrival, patient was tachypneic at 40 breaths per minute with oxygen saturation of\n90%. At the scene, EMS administered breathing treatments and checked lung sounds that did not reveal any evidence of fluid in the lung fields.\nEMS also reports patient was agitated upon their arrival at his residence. Two minutes after arrival at UTMB at 1500, the patient became\nunresponsive, apneic, and had oxygen saturations from 80-90%. The patient's heart rate decreased to asystole, was intubated with good breath\nsounds and air movement. Patient then had wide complex bradycardia and ACLS protocol for pulseless electrical activity was followed for 45\nminutes. The patient was administered TPA with no improvement. Bedside echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion. The patient was\nadministered D5W, Narcan, and multiple rounds of epinephrine and atropine, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. The patient had three\nepisodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation with cardioversion/defibrillation resulting in asystole. The patient was pronounced dead at 1605 with\nfixed, dilated pupils, no heart sounds, no pulse and no spontaneous respirations.",

      "text": "CLINICOPATHOLOGIC CORRELATION\nThis patient died shortly after a previous pulmonary embolus completely occluded the right pulmonary artery vasculature.\nThe most significant finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple old and new thromboemboli in the pulmonary vasculature of the right lung. The\nautopsy revealed evidence of multiple emboli in the right lung that were at least a few days old because the emboli that were organizing were\nadherent to the vessel wall. In order to be adherent to the vessel wall, the emboli must be in place long enough to evoke a fibroblast response,\nwhich takes at least a few days. The fatal event was not the old emboli in the right lung, but rather the thrombosis on top of the large saddle\nthrombus residing in the pulmonary artery. This created a high-pressure situation that the right ventricle could not handle resulting in cardiac\ndysfunction and ultimately the patient's demise.\nAlthough this case is fairly straight forward in terms of what caused the terminal event, perhaps the more interesting question is why a relatively\nhealthy 35-year-old man would develop a fatal pulmonary embolism. Virchow's triad suggests we should investigate endothelial injury, stasis and a\nhypercoagulable state as possible etiologies. The age of the patient probably precludes venous stasis as the sole reason for the embolus although it\ncould have certainly contributed. The autopsy revealed no evidence of endothelial damage in the pulmonary vasculature that would have caused the\nocclusion. The next logical reason would be a hypercoagulable state. Some possibilities include obesity, trauma, surgery, cancer, Factor V Leiden\ndeficiency (as well as other inherited disorders-prothrombin gene mutation, deficiencies in protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III, and disorders\nof plasminogen), and Lupus anticoagulant. Of these risks factors, obesity was the only risk factor the patient was known to have. The patient had\nno evidence of trauma, surgery, cancer or the stigmata of SLE, therefore these are unlikely. Perhaps the most fruitful search would be an\nexamination of the genetic possibilities for a hypercoagulable state (Factor V Leiden being the most common).\nIn summary, this patient died of a pulmonary embolism, the underlying cause of which is currently undetermined. A definitive diagnosis may be\nascertained with either genetic or other laboratory tests and a more detailed history.",
