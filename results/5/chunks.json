She has been using her inhaler daily. Her allergies seem to be a little bit worse as well. Her husband has\nbeen hauling corn and this seems to aggravate things. She has not been taking Allegra daily but when she does take it, it seems to help somewhat.\nShe has not been taking her Flonase which has helped her in the past. She also notes that in the past she was on Advair but she got some vaginal\nirritation with that.\nShe had been noticing increasing symptoms of irritability and PMS around her menstrual cycle. She has been more impatient around that time.\nSays otherwise her mood is normal during the rest of the month. It usually is worse the week before her cycle and improves the day her menstrual\ncycle starts. Menses have been regular but somewhat shorter than in the past. Occasionally she will get some spotting after her cycles. She denies\nany hot flashes or night sweats with this. In reviewing the chart it is noted that she did have 3+ blood with what appeared to be a urinary tract\ninfection previously. Her urine has not been rechecked. She recently had lab work and cholesterol drawn for a life insurance application and is\ngoing to send me those results when available.",

May need to increase the dose. She did get some vaginal irritation with Advair in the past but she is willing to retry that if it is necessary.\nMay also need to consider Singulair. She is to call me if she is not improving. If her shortness of breath worsens she is to call me or go into the\nemergency department. We will plan on following up for reevaluation in one month.\n2. Allergic rhinitis. We will plan on restarting Allegra and Flonase daily for the time being.\n3. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder. She may have some perimenopausal symptoms. We will start her on fluoxetine 20 mg one tablet p.o. q.d.\n4. Hematuria. Likely this is secondary to urinary tract infection but we will repeat a UA to document clearing. She does have some frequent\ndysuria but is not having it currently.\n5. Cervical dysplasia. Pap smear is taken. We will notify the patient of results. If normal we will go back to yearly Pap smear. She is scheduled for\nscreening mammogram and instructed on monthly self-breast exam techniques. Recommend she get 1200 mg of calcium and 400 U of vitamin D a\nday.",
