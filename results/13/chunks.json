Three pillows and a blanket are also received with the body. The scalp is covered in thick brown hair with flecks\nof gray. The irides are brown. There is bilateral tache noire. The eyelids are yellow and dry. The eyes have a sunken appearance. The ears and\nnose are normally developed. The mouth has partial natural dentition. The left upper first bicuspid through the molars are absent. The left lower\nbicuspid is absent. The right upper second molar is capped. The left lower first molar appears decayed. The teeth are otherwise in good repair.\nThe lips and buccal mucosa have no trauma. The neck is unremarkable except for a 2.5 cm tracheostomy scar just above the suprasternal notch.\nThe posterior portion of the neck is unremarkable and free of scars. An obliquely oriented 6 cm surgical scar is on the anterior left chest with an\nunderlying, implanted, medical device. The breasts are pendulous and otherwise unremarkable. There is white powder underneath the breasts. A\nround, 8 mm scar is on the upper central abdomen. A horizontally oriented 2.5 cm linear scar is on the central upper abdomen. A faint,\napproximately 1 cm scar is on the right mid lateral abdomen. There are a few striae on the hips and lower abdomen. The external genitalia are\nnormally developed and white powder covers the perineum. The labia are dry. The urethral meatus is visible and 3.5 mm in diameter. No objects\nor substances are in the vagina other than a slight amount of yellow-white discharge. The anus is patent and unremarkable. Faint, pink-white, flat,\n1-2 cm scars are just above the superior portion of the gluteal cleft. A 2.5 cm, somewhat square shaped, brown macule is on the left buttock.\nThere are no open and active decubitus ulcers. The upper extremities have flexion contractures with striae on the medial portions of the upper\narms. The muscles of the extremities are atrophic. The lower extremities are partially shaved. The left fifth toe is absent. The skin on the back is\nintact. The spine has accentuated thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. The skin demonstrates tenting",
