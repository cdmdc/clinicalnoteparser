      "text": "EXTERNAL EXAMINATION: \nThe autopsy is begun at 8:30 A.M. on May 24, 2004. The body is presented in a black body bag. The victim\nis wearing a white sleeveless turtleneck shirt and navy blue sweatpants. Jewelry included two smooth-textured silver hoop pierced earrings, 1-inch\ndiameter, one in each ear, and one 1-inch wide silver expandable wristband on left wrist. A 1.5-inch wide tan belt with green stripes is cinched\naround the upper neck using the buckle. The opposite end of the belt is tied in a half-hitch knot, which was used to affix it to the crossbar in the\ncloset where the body was found. \nThe body is that of a normally developed white female measuring 67 inches and weighing 118 pounds, and appearing generally consistent with the\nstated age of twenty-six years. The body is cold and unembalmed. Lividity is fixed in the distal portions of the limbs. The eyes are open. The irises\nare brown and corneas are cloudy. Petechial hemorrhaging is present in the conjunctival surfaces of the eyes. The pupils measure 0.3 cm. The hair\nis dark blonde with lighter blonde highlights, wavy, layered and approximately 11 inches in length at the longest point. \nRemoval of the belt revealed a ligature mark (known throughout this report as Ligature A) on the neck below the mandible. Ligature A is\napproximately 1.5 inches wide and encircles the neck in the form of a \"V\" on the anterior of the neck and an inverted \"V\" on the posterior of the\nneck, consistent with hanging. Minor abrasions are present in the area of Ligature A. Lack of hemorrhage surrounding Ligature A indicates this\ninjury to be post-mortem. \nUpon removal of the victim's clothing, an odor of bleach was detected. Areas of the body were swabbed and submitted for detection of\nhypochlorite. Following removal of the shirt, a second ligature mark (known throughout this report as Ligature B) was observed on the victim's\nneck. The mark is dark red ligature and encircles the neck, crossing the anterior midline of the neck just below the laryngeal prominence. The\nwidth of the mark varies between 0.8 and 1cm and is horizontal in orientation. The skin of the anterior neck above and below the ligature mark\nshows petechial hemorrhaging. Ligature B is not consistent with the belt that caused Ligature A. The absence of abrasions associated with Ligature\nB, along with the variations in the width of the ligature mark, are consistent with a soft ligature, such as a length of fabric. No trace evidence was\nrecovered from Ligature B that might assist in identification of the ligature used. \nThe genitalia are that of an adult female and there is no evidence of injury. Pubic hair has been shaved in its entirety within six hours of death. Limbs\nare equal, symmetrically developed and show no evidence of injury. The fingernails are medium length and fingernail beds are blue. There are no\nresidual scars, markings or tattoos.",
