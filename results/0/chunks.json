In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec. Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She\nhas used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has\nused over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays. She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not\nthink it is flaring up.",
