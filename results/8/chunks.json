The\nbody measures 71 inches and weighs 178 pounds.\nThe unembalmed body is well preserved and cool to touch due to refrigeration. Rigor mortis is fully developed in the major muscle groups. Livor\nmortis is fixed and purple posteriorly except over pressure points. However, during initial examination in the emergency room, there was no rigor\nand lividity was at a minimum and unfixed. The skin is intact and shows no evidence of trauma except for medical intervention. The scalp hair is\nblond and measures up to 5 inches in length in the frontal area and up to 19 inches in length in the back and on top of the head. There are multiple\nblonde hair extensions including several pink strands attached to the natural hair, which shows light brown roots. The irides are hazel and the pupils\nare equal, each measuring 0.5 centimeter in diameter. The corneae are clear and the sclerae and conjunctivae are free of petechiae. The nasal\nbones are intact by palpation. The nares are patent and contain no foreign matter. There is a 3-millimeter raised nodule on the right side of the\nnose. The natural teeth are in good condition. The frenula are intact. The oral mucosa and tongue are free of injuries. The external ears have no\ninjuries. There are bilateral earlobe piercings; no earring or jewelry were present. There are no earlobe creases.\nThe neck is symmetrical and shows no masses or injuries. The trachea is in the midline. The shoulders are symmetrical and are free of scars.\nThe chest is symmetrical and shows no evidence of injury. There were bilateral breasts with asymmetry of the left breast due to scarring. The flat\nabdomen has no injuries. There are piercings above and below the umbilicus. The back is symmetrical. The buttocks have inconspicuous small\nscars, bilaterally. There is a flat, round scar on the lower aspect of the left buttock approximately 1/2 inch in diameter.\nThe genitalia are those of a normally developed adult woman. There is no evidence of injury. The anus is unremarkable.\nThe upper extremities are symmetrical and have no injuries. The fingernails are long and clean. There is a linear 1/2 inch scar on the anterior right\nforearm. Two parallel linear scars measuring 1 inch and 2 inches are on the anterior surface of the left forearm. The lower extremities are\nsymmetrical. The toenails are short and clean. There is no edema of the legs or ankles. There is no abnormal motion of the neck, the shoulders, the\nelbows, the wrists, the fingers, the hips and ankles.
