Please refer to chart for history and physical, as well as the medical records regarding his allergic\nreaction treatment at ABC Medical Center for further details and studies. In summary, the patient had an acute event of perioral swelling, etiology\nuncertain, occurring on 05/03/2008 requiring transfer from ABC Medical Center to XYZ Medical Center due to a history of renal failure requiring\ndialysis and he was admitted and treated and felt that his allergy reaction was to Keflex, which was being used to treat a skin cellulitis dialysis shunt\ninfection. In summary, the patient states he has some problems with tolerating grass allergies, environmental and inhalant allergies occasionally, but\nhas never had anaphylactic or angioedema reactions. He currently is not taking any medication for allergies. He is taking atenolol for blood\npressure control. No further problems have been noted upon his discharge and treatment, which included corticosteroid therapy and antihistamine\ntherapy and monitoring.",

      "text": "RECOMMENDATIONS: \nRAST allergy testing for both food and environmental allergies was performed, and we will get the results back to\nthe patient with further recommendations to follow. If there is any specific food or inhalant allergen that is found to be quite high on the sensitivity\nscale, we would probably recommend the patient to avoid the offending agent to hold off on any further reactions. At this point, I would\nrecommend the patient stopping any further use of cephalosporin antibiotics, which may be the cause of his allergic reaction, and I would consider\nthis an allergy. Being on atenolol, the patient has a more difficult time treating acute anaphylaxis, but I do think this is medically necessary at this\ntime and hopefully we can find specific causes for his allergic reactions. An EpiPen was also prescribed in the event of acute angioedema or allergic\nreaction or sensation of impending allergic reaction and he is aware he needs to proceed directly to the emergency room for further evaluation and\ntreatment recommendations after administration of an EpiPen.",
